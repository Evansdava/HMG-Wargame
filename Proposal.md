# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** David Evans

**Project Name:** HexMapGen Wargame


**Is your project New or Old?** Old


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

Currently, the project creates a map based on a grid of hexagons with user-input variables. I want to build on this by placing entities on the map that try to conquer territory, similar to the board game Risk. This will involve adjusting the map generation to be suitable for a larger scale, creating rules for entities to expand by, and making it update in real time so the user can see the simulation playing out. The reason behind this addition to my project is that it will be a fun challenge to create the rules for simulation, and it will be interesting to see the results.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**

- HTML/CSS formatting problems with large maps
- Transferring data storage from Redis to another system
- Ensuring all algorithms work properly

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

Make maps bigger and more suitable for large-scale conflicts

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**

Add entities to conquer and control territory on the map

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 

Make it interactive, so the user can change things like starting positions, terrain, etc.


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### David

1. Learn enough about frontend technologies to make the website interactive
1. Create a reasonably balanced game based on random generation and decisions
1. Solve the issues with html/css that limited the last iteration of this project
